# FileManager
A very easy and fast way to upload and download files from your server. All made in NodeJS!

## Instruction

Just copy this in your nodeJS server and fire it up!
The main point is the index.js file. Currently it runs on the 8888 port, but it's easy to change that.  
To start it just `node index.js` it.  

Files will end up in the "folder" folder

## WARNING
This program is projected to work on a protected server so it doesn't implement any check or control of illicit behaviour.  
(But it's easy to add that ;) )
